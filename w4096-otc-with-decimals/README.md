## Benefits of w4096

1. It is important that people will be able to buy 4096 at higher prices. w4096 allows smaller holders to get a part of 4096 token, and maybe eventually unwrapping it into a real 4096. It also creates an easier way to DCA with small buys.
2. w4096 comes with an OTC marketplace, where w4096 owners are able to create their own pools or join others. The price of the pool can be fixed or follow the market price of 4096 with an optional additional price or a discount (in fixed ETH or %).
3. There are taxes on w4096, but reversed. On every buy there is a 5% tax (like 5% tax on every 20+ tokens sell of 4096), of which 4% will be burned. This burn directly benefits 4096, as you can only get w4096 by wrapping original 4096 tokens!
4. w4096 and the existence of OTC marketplace allows more trading tactics for smart traders, thus just increasing the volume on both 4096 and w4096.
5. w4096 gives an opportunity to sell your tokens avoiding the guaranteed burn cycles. This is extremely relevant for small holders who cannot afford to pay the guaranteed burn tax.

# 4096 Club

4096 Club is an exclusive community of 4096 holders.

{% hint style="info" %}
Club will go live before the end of February 2024. It is not available yet.
{% endhint %}

Being a member of the Club gives you the following opportunities:

1. Get WL spots for presales of the projects in which 4096 Dev/Core Community will be involved in some way, or projects with a team that can be vetted for.
2. Get early/pre-launch info about projects that 4096 is partnering/collaborating with or projects that are connected with 4096 Dev/Core Community or other 4096 Club members.
3. Share projects and see what other 4096 holders are sharing with their cumulative 4096 holding Tier being displayed, thus a whale sharing something will be much more trustworthy.

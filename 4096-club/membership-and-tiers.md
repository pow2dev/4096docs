# Membership & Tiers

Buy at least 1 whole token and hold it for 7 days to be a Club member. This will grant you the Tier VIII. There are total of 8 tiers.

{% hint style="info" %}
7 days delay is not yet implemented. It will be live simultaneously with the Club going live.
{% endhint %}

| Tier | Hold amount |
| ---- | ----------- |
| VIII | 1           |
| VII  | 2           |
| VI   | 3           |
| V    | 4-7         |
| IV   | 8-15        |
| III  | 16-31       |
| II   | 32-63       |
| I    | 64+         |

To get a higher Tier you need to buy additional tokens and hold them for 7 days. Tier will be automatically updated after you hold a certain amount for a whole week. If you see your Tier and its lower than it should be, then 7 days did not pass yet counting from your latest purchases.

## What are the Tier benefits?

There are no certain benefits, but higher tiers might get more and earlier information as well as priority spots in any events there might be.

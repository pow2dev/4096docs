    Read the [Pool's parameters](pools-parameters.md) page to understand what Min/Max prices are. Setup the additional price or discount (you can leave it at 0 if you don't want to add or deduct from the market price).
4.  Optionally, you can make your pool private:\

    This will restrict the pool deposits to your address only, meaning no one else can join your pool except you. This will also make it possible to edit the pool's parameters at any moment (MIN/MAX prices or/and additional price/discount).
5. If you want to create a pool that can be bought exclusively by a certain address, then input this address as whitelisted. Leave the whitelisted input box blank if you want anyone to be able to buy your pool. You can edit, add or remove whitelisted address at any time BUT one pool can only have one (or zero) whitelisted address.

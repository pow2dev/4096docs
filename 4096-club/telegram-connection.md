# Telegram connection

You need to connect your ETH wallet(s) with your Telegram account to be a member of the Club.

Message 4096 bot: [https://t.me/4096ERC\_bot](https://t.me/ERC4096\_bot) and type `/connect` to proceed.

The bot will give you a link to the 4096 App to connect your account. It will take you to the "TG connect" tab:

You would need to sign a message to confirm the ownership of the wallet. After signing, go back to Telegram and type `/confirm 0xYourAddress` to finalize the connection.

**When signing any messages with your wallet, make sure you understand the contents of the message. In this case, it will be a text in the format **_**your TG ID**_** -> **_**your address**_
{% endhint %}

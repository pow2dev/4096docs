# Tech & Communication

There is no special private group for 4096 Club. All the communication will be done through a Telegram bot and a public Telegram channel.

Here are some key points you should know before the Club is live:

1. Communication in the Club is anonymous and is done exclusively through the 4096 bot. Breaking this rule might result in sanctions against you.
2. There is a half-automated, half-manual moderation process. To ensure scam, hateful and low-quality content is filtered, all the messages that members submit to the bot are published with a delay later at a random moment of the day.
3. You can send your messages not only to the Club members (choosing the minimum Tier required for members to receive your message), but also to the public channel. Same rules apply.
4. Every member has their unique club ID. It is different from the telegram ID and allows to identify messages that are written by the same member while still keeping them anonymous.
5. There is a global daily limit on how many messages can be submitted. There is no queue, so if the limit is exceeded, the bot won't accept any more messages and you would need to monitor the bot for the next available slots. It won't notify you when these slots are open.\
   Tier I has its own exclusive limit different from public limits. So if there are no public slots, Tier I members will use their exclusive quota.
